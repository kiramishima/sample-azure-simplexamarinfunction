# Modifying the Xamarin.Forms client to use the Azure Function

We know that our function works well now, because we tested it [in the Azure Portal](./implementing.md#testing-the-new-signature) and [in Visual Studio 2017](./creating-vs.md#testing-the-function). Now we will build a Xamarin.Forms client app that runs on iOS, Android and Windows to use this new function.

In the previous step, we copied the function's URL for later usage. Make sure to keep this URL handy, we will need it later in the client's code.
